# React-App
This is the simple react app I have created as a part of the selection process for an internship as a front-end developer.


I've tried to apply HTML(JSX in case of react) & CSS to create as accurate UI screens as possible and added some basic functionality I could with my knowledge of VanillaJS and beginner ReactJS.
